/**
 * The `Queue` is responsible for managing your operations and ensuring not too
 * many operations are executed at once. It's a very simple and lightweight
 * in-memory implementation of the
 * [leaky bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket#As_a_queue) algorithm.
 *
 * This means that you control how many operations can be executed concurrently.
 * If you add a job to the queue and it still below the limit, it will be executed
 * immediately. If you keep adding new jobs to the queue and its concurrency limit
 * is reached, it will not start a new operation and instead queue this for future
 * execution. Once one of the pending operations complete, it will pick the next
 * job from the qeueue and execute this operation.

     * Instantiates a new queue object.
     *
     * You can create any number of queues, for example when you want to apply
     * different limits to different kind of operations.
     *
     * The `$concurrency` parameter sets a new soft limit for the maximum number
     * of jobs to handle concurrently. Finding a good concurrency limit depends
     * on your particular use case. It's common to limit concurrency to a rather
     * small value, as doing more than a dozen of things at once may easily
     * overwhelm the receiving side.
     *
     * The `$limit` parameter sets a new hard limit on how many jobs may be
     * outstanding (kept in memory) at once. Depending on your particular use
     * case, it's usually safe to keep a few hundreds or thousands of jobs in
     * memory. If you do not want to apply an upper limit, you can pass a `null`
     * value which is semantically more meaningful than passing a big number.
     *
     * ```php
     * // handle up to 10 jobs concurrently, but keep no more than 1000 in memory
     * $q = new Queue(10, 1000, $handler);
     * ```
     *
     * ```php
     * // handle up to 10 jobs concurrently, do not limit queue size
     * $q = new Queue(10, null, $handler);
     * ```
     *
     * ```php
     * // handle up to 10 jobs concurrently, reject all further jobs
     * $q = new Queue(10, 10, $handler);
     * ```
     *
     * The `$handler` parameter must be a valid callable that accepts your job
     * parameters, invokes the appropriate operation and returns a Promise as a
     * placeholder for its future result.
     *
     * ```php
     * // using a Closure as handler is usually recommended
     * $q = new Queue(10, null, function ($url) use ($browser) {
     *     return $browser->get($url);
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * ```php
     * // PHP's array callable as handler is also supported
     * $q = new Queue(10, null, array($browser, 'get'));
     * ```
     *
     * @param int      $concurrency concurrency soft limit
     * @param int|null $limit       queue hard limit or NULL=unlimited
     * @param callable $handler
